# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP is a coding paradigm in which objects are the basis for code development. Every object is the instance of a blueprint called a class. A class can be instantiated as many times as needed to create as many objects as necessary. Methods and attributes can be defined within the class and will be available for access for the instantiated object. Functional programming relies on functions as the building blocks for code functionality. 

Researched answer:

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float contains a decimal ('.') and an integer does not. They are instantiations of different classes: Integer in the case integers and Float in the case of floats, which means they have different properties and methods from each other. 

Researched answer:

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It is built into the methods without the need of a special keyword as in Javascript where the keyword "return" is necessary within a function (explicit return). 

Researched answer:

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block is a custom method that can be passed to Ruby's built in methods. It is identified by the syntax "do-end." The keyword "do" marks the beginning of the block and "end" marks the end of the block. Ruby blocks are used to extend the functionality of built in methods to custom needs of the user. 

Researched answer:

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Dot notation as well as bracket notation (?).
